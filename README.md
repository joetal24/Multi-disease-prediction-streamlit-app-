# Multi-disease Prediction Streamlit App

A Streamlit web application that provides quick, on-device predictions for multiple diseases using machine learning models. This repository contains the code, model artifacts (or inference code), and UI components required to run an interactive app where users can input health parameters and receive model-predicted risk/diagnosis for several common conditions.

Note: This README is written to be broadly useful whether you already have model files included in the repo or plan to plug in your own trained models.

## Features

- Web UI built with Streamlit for quick prototyping and demos.
- Modular screens/pages for multiple disease predictions.
- Input forms for user clinical/demographic features.
- Model inference pipeline (preprocessing → inference → postprocessing).
- Easy to extend: add new disease models and UI pages.

## Supported Predictions

The repository aims to predict multiple diseases (replace or extend with the models you have). Typical examples for this kind of app:

- Diabetes risk classification
- Heart disease risk / diagnosis
- Parkinson's disease detection
- (Add yours — Alzheimer, breast cancer, chronic kidney disease, etc.)

Update this section to list the exact diseases/models included in the repo.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/joetal24/Multi-disease-prediction-streamlit-app-.git
2. Move into the project directory:
   cd Multi-disease-prediction-streamlit-app-
3. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
4. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py

If your main file is named differently (for example, `Multi_disease_app.py` or `main.py`), replace `app.py` with the correct filename.

## Installation

Install from the included requirements file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Typical dependencies:

- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib (or pickle)
- xgboost / lightgbm (if models use them)

Add any extra libraries that your models require to requirements.txt.

## Running the App

Start the Streamlit server:

streamlit run app.py

Open the address printed in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501) to interact with the UI. Provide feature values in the form, choose a disease prediction page, and click the predict button to see results.

## Project Structure

A typical layout for this project:

- app.py (or main Streamlit script)
- requirements.txt
- README.md
- models/
  - diabetes_model.pkl
  - heart_disease_model.pkl
  - parkinsons_model.pkl
- src/ or app_modules/
  - preprocessing.py
  - predict.py
  - ui.py
- data/ (optional — sample data or CSVs)
- assets/ (images, icons)
- notebooks/ (training/EDA notebooks)

Update the structure section to match the actual repository file/folder names.

## How it works (high-level)

1. The user chooses a disease and fills a form with relevant features.
2. Inputs are validated and preprocessed the same way the model expects (scaling, encoding, etc.).
3. A trained model is loaded and run on the processed features.
4. The app displays the prediction (class label, probability, or risk score) and optionally an explanation.

Ensure your preprocessing logic exactly matches what was used during model training — mismatches cause degraded predictions.

## Adding or Updating Models

To add another disease model:
1. Train and export the model (joblib or pickle recommended).
2. Add any preprocessing pipeline or scaler used during training to the repo.
3. Place the model file in the `models/` folder.
4. Add a new Streamlit page or expand the UI with a new form and wire it to your inference function.
5. Update README and requirements if you add new dependencies.

## Testing

Include unit tests for data preprocessing, inference, and UI logic where possible. Use pytest for automated tests:

pip install pytest
pytest

Expand tests to cover boundary cases and invalid input handling.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

- Fork the repository
- Create a topic branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
- Make changes and add tests
- Open a Pull Request describing your change

Please follow standard Python style (PEP8) and add or update README and tests for significant changes.

If you'd like, I can:
- Generate a tailored README that lists the exact model files and app entrypoint if you tell me the repository tree or point me to files.
- Create a requirements.txt based on imports found in the project.
- Draft a LICENSE file (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.).
